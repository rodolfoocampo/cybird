## CyBird

### A smart house for selective feeding of native species and bird monitoring

This project was created as a part of the [3Ai](https://3ainstitute.org/) masters program at the Australian National University, where we study the development of safe, sustainable and responsible AI-enabled cyberphysical systems. 

Our aim is to create a project that can bring humans closer to nature, enable safe bird feeding through selective, non-invasive species feeding and promote involvement in citizen science to generate data on urban birds. 

To run the project, you will need: 

- Raspberry Pi 3
- Edge TPU
- Servo Motor
- A food dispense
